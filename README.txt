Project Emploees


Building Flask project using SQLAlchemy,sqlite and working with Jinja templates .
For the project's purpose I install python flask and sqlalchemy. 

 Create a basic application with follow functionality:
- Add new data - from home page can  add name, email and phone number of new employee.
After enter data need to pop up information " Employee is successfully added" 
- Update the data - from home page can update name, email or phone number of existing employee.
After enter the data it needs to pop up with this information " Employee is successfully added" 
- Delete the data - when tap delete button have to pop up " Employee is successfully deleted " 

There are two directories static and templates, app.py, create.py, data.db
I would make future improvements about flash because at the moment the message cannot appear.
